## 🌍 Environment Variables

Your Sanity configuration is currently hardcoded in `frontend/src/lib/sanity.ts`:
- Project ID: `80je9ukv`
- Dataset: `production`

If you want to use environment variables instead, add these in Vercel:
- `PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID` = `80je9ukv`
- `PUBLIC_SANITY_DATASET` = `production`

Then update `frontend/src/lib/sanity.ts` to use them.

## 📝 API Routes

All your API routes in `frontend/src/routes/api/` will automatically work as Vercel Serverless Functions:
- `/api/categories`
- `/api/cities`
- `/api/posts`
- `/api/projects`
- `/api/team-members`
- `/api/site-settings`
- `/api/featured-posts`
- `/api/proxy-image`
